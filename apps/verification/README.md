# Usage
To generate the main.c and vinsn_rand_seq.S files with specific sequence length and number of sequences, run:

```bash
make SEQ_LENGTH=6 NUM_SEQS=10
```

This will create the output directory in the parent directory and place the main.c and vinsn_rand_seq.S files inside it.
The SEQ_LENGTH and NUM_SEQS variables can be adjusted as needed when running the make command.
The generated files will include comments at the beginning indicating they were auto-generated by the Python script.
